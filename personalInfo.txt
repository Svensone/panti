------------ lesson learned ----------

npm start to start development - localhost 3000

git init
    git remote set-url origin new-url (since already exists)



1) folder structure

2) React-router-dom
    creating Routes in constants
    setting up Navigation Component with ul and Link Component from react-router-dom
    in App.js creating Route path={} component={}

3) Firebase set-up 
    create Project in console.firebase.com (Panti-dev and Panti-prod)
    in Firebase Component - firebase.js with config of Project 
        2 configs (dev and prod)
        install firebase
        import Firebase

    Attention !!!!!! 
        better with .env file where we store the config and then import to firebase.js with REACT_APP_API_KEY
        .gitignore .env

    Not yet implement env.production and panti-prod config from firebase console Project
